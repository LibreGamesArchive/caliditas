HELP_INTRO,"In this card game the key attribute is the _temperature_ of the cards. Every _creature_ has a _temperature_ and can only attack and destroy weaker _creatures_ of the opposite element (both of them are destroyed when absolute _temperature_ values are equal). Therefore the _temperature_ attribute serves as combined attack and defense value."
HELP_1,"In addition to creatures there are also _spell_ cards. Many of them can alter the _temperature_ of your or your enemy's creatures."
HELP_2,"If the enemy has no creatures on the battle field to protect him you deal damage to him equal to the absolute value your current _temperature_. This means you can't reduce your opponent health while using a balanced set of ice and fire creatures."
HELP_3,"Your _creatures_ can attack right after you end your turn. Select a target to attack for each of your creatures before ending your turn! Note that the attacker is destroyed as well if both fighting creatures are equally strong. If there are no creatures left after your attack phase you may deal damage to your opponent, but only up to 10 points per turn. Both players start with 20 _health_."
HELP_4,"If a player is hurt he draws an additional card on his next turn. Otherwise the player draws one card at the start of his turn. It is also possible to draw an additional card each turn, but this will reduce your max mana by one point."
HELP_5,"Cards require _mana_ in order to be played. Each player starts with 3 mana points and gets one more point for each turn passed."
HELP_6,"Left mouse button to select cards, right mouse button to enlarge cards."
