HELP_INTRO,"In this card game the key attribute is the _temperature_ of the cards. Every _creature_ has a _temperature_ and can only attack and destroy weaker _creatures_ of the opposite element (both of them are destroyed when absolute _temperature_ values are equal). Therefore the _temperature_ attribute serves as combined attack and defense value."
HELP_1,"In addition to creatures there are also _spell_ cards. Many of them can alter the _temperature_ of your or your enemy's creatures."
HELP_2,"If the enemy has no creatures on the battle field to protect him you deal damage to him equal to the absolute value your current _temperature_. This means you can't reduce your opponent health while using a balanced set of ice and fire creatures."
HELP_3,"Your _creatures_ attack right after you end your turn. They chose to attack a random creature and prefer weaker creatures as the attacker is destroyed as well if both fighting creatures are equally strong. If there are no creatures left after your attack you may deal damage to your opponent, but only up to 10 points per turn. Both players start with 20 _health_."
HELP_4,"If a player is hurt he draws an additional card next turn. If his _health_ drops below 50% for the first time he draws 4 cards instead. Otherwise the player draws one card at the start of his turn."
HELP_5,"Cards require _mana_ in order to be played. Each player starts with 3 mana points and gets one more point for each turn passed."
HELP_6,"Left mouse button to select cards, right mouse button for zoom."

TUTORIAL_ATTRIBUTES3,"The temperature determines the creatures alignment to fire or ice and its combat strength."
TUTORIAL_ATTRIBUTES4,"Fire creatures have positive temperature and ice creatures have a negative one. The larger the absolute value of the temperature is the stronger the creature is."
